    <div style="margin-top:1.25rem; max-width:720px;">Srishti Institute of Art, Design & Technology (now. Srishti Manipal) and the National School of Drama, Bangalore collaborated in 2019 on a multilingual Nataka performance with glimpses from Girish Karnad's plays Hayavadana, Agni Mattu Male, and Naga Mandala for the Karnad Utsav. The project aimed to showcase the diverse cultural and linguistic identities of India through theatre and performance art.

C. Basavalingaiah directed the plays, which explored themes such as identity, desire, and power. The project involved intensive rehearsals, and set design, culminating in a series of public performances that highlighted the unique voices and perspectives of the actors and crew. The project aimed to foster collaboration and exchange between the institutions and inspire dialogue around the role of theatre and performance art in shaping cultural identity.</div>
