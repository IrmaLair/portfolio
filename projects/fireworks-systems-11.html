    <div style="margin-top:1.25rem; max-width:720px;">In the Systems Thinking course, students analyze and redesign complex systems, focusing on fireworks. They address the challenge of enjoying firecrackers while ensuring safety and awareness to prevent harm to people, animals, and the environment.

Proposed solutions include using sarcasm and humor in marketing materials to improve communication to consumers, creating a consolidated fireworks library, and developing AR/VR experiences to educate users on safety, pollution, and social impacts. Students also reimagine fireworks as biodegradable, organic materials with mechanisms inspired by seed dispersal biomimicry.

Additionally, they design packaging that uses sarcasm to highlight the harmful effects of fireworks on pets and wildlife, combining creativity with impactful messaging.</div>
