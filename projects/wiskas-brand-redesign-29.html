        <div class="card-excerpt">Whiskas is a brand of catfood sold internationally. It has been around for almost 80 years and counting. Whiskas is owned by Mars incorporated. Previously, it was known as Kal Kan, but to sell the product internationally, in 1988 it was renamed as Whiskas. The brand serves healthy, meat-based cat food and was the first brand to offer variety in pet food which made it popular. The reason I chose to work on this particular brand is because it promises to keep my cat healthy. The trust I have in this brand, makes it one of my favourites. Previously, I had tried out a few products from competitor brands like Drools and Let's Bite, but my cat seemed to prefer this one.</div>
