    <div style="margin-top:1.25rem; max-width:720px;">Are you ready for some lights, camera, action?! In this project, we explored the world of film-making and boy, did it take us on a wild ride! Starting from scratch, we had to come up with our own stories and bring them to life with sound and visuals. It was a learning curve, but we quickly discovered that inspiration can be found all around us - even in the most unlikely places. The film-making process bridged the gap between us and the local community as we captured the 'men at work', or should I say 'women at work'.</div>
