        <div class="card-excerpt">Our aim is to blur the lines between man-made and machine-made art and make people question everything they know about creativity. Our goal is to create an interactive art piece that will make viewers go &quot;whoa!&quot; and &quot;huh?&quot; at the same time. We're talking about an installation that involves a computer program using any kind of medium from water to chalk dust, and everything in between to create artistic paintings. And the best part? The audience gets to be part of the creation process! They can interact with the installation in real-time, creating an unique experience and leaving their artistic mark on the piece. Who knew computers could be so creative, right?</div>
