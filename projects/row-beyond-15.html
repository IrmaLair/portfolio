    <div style="margin-top:1.25rem; max-width:720px;">Row Beyond combines real sports with tech, turning rowing practice into a virtual experience. It imitates actual water conditions, offers posture feedback, and provides endurance workouts, giving athletes and fitness fans a secure but lifelike method to improve. If you rotate your hand wrong or have bad posture, the system shows you how to fix it.

By mixing motion tracking, physics settings, and feedback for multiple senses, rowing becomes precise and fun. For rowers who can't easily get to calm open waters, Row Beyond is an easy-to-carry option that boosts their ability and opens up the sport to everyone.</div>
