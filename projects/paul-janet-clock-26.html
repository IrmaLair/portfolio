        <div class="card-excerpt">We all know how our perception of time changes as our life span increases. Most of us feel that time moved very slowly when we were younger and it gradually speeds up as we grow older. We usually become conscious of this speeding up when our lives become ordered into routines (routines make us lose sense of time).\n\nThis is exactly what Paul Janet's theory on time is about. Based on this theory, a 5 year old child feels a year as 1/5th of his/her whole life while a man of 30 feels a year as 1/30th of his whole life. Previously, he was known as Kal Kan, but to sell the product internationally, in 1988 it was renamed as Whiskas. The brand serves healthy, meat-based cat food and was the first brand to offer variety in pet food which made it popular.\n\nThe reason I chose to work on this particular brand is because it promises to keep my cat healthy. The trust I have in this brand, makes it one of my favourites. Previously, I had tried out a few products from competitor brands like Drools and Let's Bite, but my cat seemed to prefer this one.</div>
