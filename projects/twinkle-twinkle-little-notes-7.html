    <div style="margin-top:1.25rem; max-width:720px;">This project is a thrilling journey of creativity, experimentation and innovation that brings rhymes to life for children with a preference for visual learning. Our goal is to use the magic of technology to transform musical notes into pixels. Pixels, the smallest unit of an image is what this project is based off of. The visuals engage and captivate young learners. With every note progression in the song, our visuals will evolve, creating a one-of-a-kind experience for each rhyme. For this project, we chose to work on the famous rhyme 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' as it motivates kids to aim for the skies. But that's not all - our project also acts as a unique learning tool for people who want to explore the world of music. By exploring the interplay between programming, experience design and experimental design, we crafted an experience that will leave a lasting impression. This project tries to go beyond traditional media and push the boundaries of what's possible.</div>
