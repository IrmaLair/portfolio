        <h3>Tribal Displacement</h3>
        <div class="project-meta">Motion Graphics Design · Apr, 2025 · 2 Weeks</div>
        <div class="card-excerpt">“Displaced Development” is a satirical piece using motion graphics and sound to explore the sad realities of tribal communities living in forests. It features a watercolor puppet animation style. The visuals embrace the charm of handmade flaws, with cutout puppetry to express both literal and deeper ideas, such as leaving home shown as a runaway marble. The watercolor is soft, but it clashes with the tough realities faced by Adivasis who are forced to give up their forests for factories. The sound design mixes forest &amp; city sounds with a sarcastic narration that feels personal yet jarring. The project wraps up with music from an Irula tribe member I met in Bandipur's forest back in 2019. With its layered storytelling, the project pushes viewers to think about the ridiculousness of development and the voices that often get ignored.</div>
