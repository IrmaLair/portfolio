        <div class="card-excerpt">Most of India's information on pollinating insects is still insufficient to understand the state of bees in our country including their population, which begs the question of why and how they should be conserved. This project aims to change the outlook towards bees in the Indian context. Currently, many of us see them as pests, so through my product concept, I hope to make urban dwellers accustomed to the knowledge and existence of bees so they are not just tolerated but welcomed visitors to our gardens.</div>
