        <div class="card-excerpt">The Smart Shopping Cart is a tangible computing project aimed at solving common problems we face when shopping, like long lines at checkout, billing mistakes, and confusing systems. This cart uses a camera and AI to detect items, so it knows what you’re buying and keeps track of your total as you shop. There’s a screen that shows your running total, and you can pay using online systems, which means you don’t have to wait in line to check out. It also has a locking mechanism that keeps your stuff safe once it recognizes your items. Looking ahead, the plan is to add features like AR to display product info and deals, personalized shopping based on customer profiles, and data analysis to help stores improve layouts. By combining tech with a user-friendly design, the Smart Cart aims to make shopping quicker, safer, and more enjoyable.</div>
