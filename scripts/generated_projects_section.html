      <div class="card-excerpt">Most of India's information on pollinating insects is still insufficient to understand the state of bees in our country including their population, which begs the question of why and how they should be conserved. This project aims to change the outlook towards bees in the Indian context. Currently, many of us see them as pests, so through my product concept, I hope to make urban dwellers accustomed to the knowledge and existence of bees so they are not just tolerated but welcomed visitors to our gardens.</div>

      <div class="card-excerpt">This project is a thrilling journey of creativity, experimentation and innovation that brings rhymes to life for children with a preference for visual learning. Our goal is to use the magic of technology to transform musical notes into pixels. Pixels, the smallest unit of an image is what this project is based off of. The visuals engage and captivate young learners. With every note progression in the song, our visuals will evolve, creating a one-of-a-kind experience for each rhyme. For this project, we chose to work on the famous rhyme 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' as it motivates kids to aim for the skies. But that's not all - our project also acts as a unique learning tool for people who want to explore the world of music. By exploring the interplay between programming, experience design and experimental design, we crafted an experience that will leave a lasting impression. This project tries to go beyond traditional media and push the boundaries of what's possible.</div>

It features a watercolor puppet animation style. The visuals embrace the charm of handmade flaws, with cutout puppetry to express both literal and deeper ideas, such as leaving home shown as a runaway marble. The watercolor is soft, but it clashes with the tough realities faced by Adivasis who are forced to give up their forests for factories.<br><br>The sound design mixes forest &amp; city sounds with a sarcastic narration that feels personal yet jarring. The project wraps up with music from an Irula tribe member I met in Bandipur's forest back in 2019. With its layered storytelling, the project pushes viewers to think about the ridiculousness of development and the voices that often get ignored.</div>

      <div class="card-excerpt">We all know how our perception of time changes as our life span increases. Most of us feel that time moved very slowly when we were younger and it gradually speeds up as we grow older. We usually become conscious of this speeding up when our lives become ordered into routines (routines make us lose sense of time).<br><br>This is exactly what Paul Janet's theory on time is about. Based on this theory, a 5 year old child feels a year as 1/5th of his/her whole life while a man of 30 feels a year as 1/30th of his whole life. Previously, he was known as Kal Kan, but to sell the product internationally, in 1988 it was renamed as Whiskas. The brand serves healthy, meat-based cat food and was the first brand to offer variety in pet food which made it popular.<br><br>The reason I chose to work on this particular brand is because it promises to keep my cat healthy. The trust I have in this brand, makes it one of my favourites. Previously, I had tried out a few products from competitor brands like Drools and Let's Bite, but my cat seemed to prefer this one.</div>
